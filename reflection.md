- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


The encapsulation was a little hard to follow at times, but it was nice to see it all come together in the Train class. I definitely got very used to making for loops in Java. I think the most confuisng part was figuring out the interactions between the car and the passenger class, so probably my advice would be to really think that one through.
